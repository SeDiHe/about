## Semiconductor – dielectric heterostructures for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution ##

<div style="text-align: justify;">SeDiHe, a joint Czech - Slovenian research project, focuses on photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for H<sub>2</sub> generation from heterostructures that combine a protective oxide layer (POL) with a semiconductor. We propose a radically new approach to assemble these two dissimilar material systems in order to create an atomically defined interface. The idea is based on nanostructuring using a graphene oxide (GO) layer, which should have a crucial role in van der Waals epitaxy between the constituents, as well as their electronic coupling. The heterostructures are integrated into semi-PEC reactors, where a photovoltaic (PV) cell supplies an additional external voltage to achieve H<sub>2</sub> production.<br /> 
<br /> 
Success of this strategy requires detailed knowledge of:
<ul>
  <li>the key parameters contributing to higher efficiency of H<sub>2</sub> generation from PEC water splitting, such as defect concentrations and atomic structure of the interface,</li>
  <li>options to engineer band offsets using various dielectric POL materials,</li>
  <li>factors limiting solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of semi-PEC reactors made of these novel heterostructures.</li>
</ul>
